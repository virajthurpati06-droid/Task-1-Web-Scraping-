# Task-1-Web-Scraping
In Task 1, I performed Web Scraping using Python to extract data from a public website. I used the Requests library to connect to the website and retrieve its HTML content. Then, I used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML structure and identify relevant elements such as headings and paragraph data.

After extracting the required information, I cleaned and organized the data into a structured format using Pandas, and saved it as a CSV file for further analysis.

This task helped me understand how websites store data in HTML format and how to programmatically collect that data. It also improved my skills in data extraction, handling web content, and building datasets from online sources.

Conclusion:

In this task, I successfully implemented web scraping techniques to collect data from a public website using Python. By utilizing libraries like Requests and BeautifulSoup, I was able to extract relevant information, convert it into a structured format, and save it as a CSV file.

This task enhanced my understanding of how web data can be accessed and processed programmatically. It also improved my practical skills in data extraction, HTML parsing, and dataset creation, which are essential for real-world data analysis projects.
